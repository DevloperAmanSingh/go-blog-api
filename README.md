Creating a README file for your project is a great way to document its setup and usage. Here's a basic template you can use:

---

# Go Blog API

This is a simple blog API built with Go and Fiber framework, using MongoDB as the database.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-blog-api.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
   ```

4. Start the MongoDB server:

   Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine or update the `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file with the MongoDB connection string.

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
